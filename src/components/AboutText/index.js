            I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for design.  I strive to create my clients the perfect aesthetic for their brand and make their visions come to life online In 2019, I sucessfully completed University of California, San Diegoâ€™s Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  Attending this program taught me how to develope both the client and server side.
            Spending ten years employed in the Hospitality industry gave me experience in remaining organized and maintaining attention to detail while facing deadlines in high pressure work environments. 
            In my freetime, I enjoy horseback riding, attending concerts and spending time with my dog, Yoshi.
